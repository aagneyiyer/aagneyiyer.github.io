## Context

Being a consulting firm, Accenture assigns each intern to a client project. Here's what my client engagement was all about.

Sike, I signed a million NDAs pledging my sincerest integrity to data privacy or something. But since you're curious, my client is a US-based automated eligibility system. I was on a team that ingests and curates reports from Oracle and S3 buckets, and runs periodic jobs to keep curating in regular intervals.

## Outcome

On my first day, one of my managers told me that I can get as much or as little out of this internship as I'd like. I used this as a guiding principle throughout my summer, for better or for worse.

My project involved a good few technologies. At a very high level, I used PySpark - the Python API for Apache Spark - to pull data from Oracle and S3 buckets and insert them into Amazon RDS tables. My project saves batch processing teams a few hours each week in manual lookups.

Outside of work duties, I had such a fun summer with the rest of the interns. Genuinely the most chill group of coworkers I could have asked for. We had a lot of social events, mostly voluntary and not company-affiliated.
